Coffee_CQI_Total_Cup_Points:
This code creates a scatter plot using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize data from a CSV file. In this example, we will use Python to create a scatter plot of 'Moisture' against 'altitude_mean_meters' with 'Total.Cup.Points' as the color scale.

Coffee_CQI_Total_Cup_Points_by_Countries:
The code harnesses Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for the creation of two essential plots. The first plot is a scatter plot, showcasing the correlation between altitude and total cup points. Additionally, the code employs Seaborn to construct a pairplot, enabling the exploration of pairwise relationships and data distributions while also facilitating differentiation based on the country of origin. These libraries collectively enable effective data processing and visualization, resulting in valuable insights derived from the two generated plots.

Create Coffee_CQI_Total_Cup_Points_by_Countries_and_Cupper_Points:
The code presented is a Python script for creating a scatter plot using Seaborn and Matplotlib. It begins by importing the necessary libraries (Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas). Then, the script loads data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. The main part of the code generates the scatter plot, showing the relationship between 'altitude_mean_meters' and 'Total.Cup.Points' while using color, marker style, and marker size to distinguish data points based on 'Country.of.Origin' and 'Cupper.Points'. The script customizes the figure's size and aspect ratio. Finally, the script uses Matplotlib to display the scatter plot. This code adheres to best practices for creating informative scatter plots.

Physicians per thousand vs. Maternal mortality ratio: 
The provided Python code utilizes the pandas and seaborn libraries to create a customized scatter plot visualizing the relationship between the number of physicians per thousand people and the maternal mortality ratio for various countries. The code reads data from a CSV file, sets the Seaborn theme, and creates a scatter plot with labeled axes and a title. The size of the markers is based on the maternal mortality ratio, and the points are colored according to the country. The legend is customized and positioned in the upper left corner. Finally, the plot is displayed using matplotlib.pyplot.show(). Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-world-2023
