Coffee_CQI_Total_Cup_Points:
This code creates a scatter plot using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize data from a CSV file. In this example, we will use Python to create a scatter plot of 'Moisture' against 'altitude_mean_meters' with 'Total.Cup.Points' as the color scale.

Coffee_CQI_Total_Cup_Points_by_Countries:
The code harnesses Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for the creation of two essential plots. The first plot is a scatter plot, showcasing the correlation between altitude and total cup points. Additionally, the code employs Seaborn to construct a pairplot, enabling the exploration of pairwise relationships and data distributions while also facilitating differentiation based on the country of origin. These libraries collectively enable effective data processing and visualization, resulting in valuable insights derived from the two generated plots.
