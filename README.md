# Examples
Halloween_candy: 
This code generates a scatter plot that visually compares the sugar and price percentiles of fruity and non-fruity candies, helping you analyze the relationship between these variables based on the dataset.

Coffee_CQI_Total_Cup_Points:
This code creates a scatter plot using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize data from a CSV file. In this example, we will use Python to create a scatter plot of 'Moisture' against 'altitude_mean_meters' with 'Total.Cup.Points' as the color scale.

Coffee_CQI_Total_Cup_Points_by_Countries:
The code harnesses Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for the creation of two essential plots. The first plot is a scatter plot, showcasing the correlation between altitude and total cup points. Additionally, the code employs Seaborn to construct a pairplot, enabling the exploration of pairwise relationships and data distributions while also facilitating differentiation based on the country of origin. These libraries collectively enable effective data processing and visualization, resulting in valuable insights derived from the two generated plots.

Create Coffee_CQI_Total_Cup_Points_by_Countries_and_Cupper_Points:
The code presented is a Python script for creating a scatter plot using Seaborn and Matplotlib. It begins by importing the necessary libraries (Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas). Then, the script loads data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. The main part of the code generates the scatter plot, showing the relationship between 'altitude_mean_meters' and 'Total.Cup.Points' while using color, marker style, and marker size to distinguish data points based on 'Country.of.Origin' and 'Cupper.Points'. The script customizes the figure's size and aspect ratio. Finally, the script uses Matplotlib to display the scatter plot. This code adheres to best practices for creating informative scatter plots.
